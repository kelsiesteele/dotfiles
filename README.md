# My Linux Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles and general system preferences adapted (loosely speaking) for Ubuntu. They'll probably work fine with any Debian-based distro, but I've only tested them on Ubuntu.

**Running OS X? Check out my the [master branch](https://github.com/joshukraine/dotfiles).**

### WIP README!!

### Installation

Want to read through the script first?
