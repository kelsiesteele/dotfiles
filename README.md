# My Dotfiles for OS X

These are the dotfiles I use on my MacBook Pro running OS X El Capitan. They are geared primarily for Ruby on Rails development using zsh, vim, and tmux. Also included is my iTerm 2 profile.


### Mac Bootstrap Script

This repo previously contained my entire provisioning solution for a new machine running a fresh install of OS X. I've now extracted the provisioning functionality into its own repository. Check it out:

&#9657; **Provision a new Mac with [Mac Bootstrap](https://github.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap).**

NOTE: Mac Bootstrap automatically clones and installs this dotfiles repo.


### Prerequisites

The dotfiles assume you are running OS X (10.10 or higher) with the following software preinstalled:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [Tmux](http://tmux.github.io/)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)

All of the above and more are included in [Mac Bootstrap](https://github.com/joshukraine/mac-bootstrap).

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/joshukraine/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
source ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```


### Post-install Tasks

After running `install.sh` there are still a couple of things that need to be done.

* Set up iTerm 2 profile (see details below).
* Add personal data to `~/.gitconfig.local` and `~/.zshrc.local`.


### Setting up iTerm 2

Thanks to a [great blog post](http://stratus3d.com/blog/2015/02/28/sync-iterm2-profile-with-dotfiles-repository/) by Trevor Brown, I learned that you can quickly set up iTerm 2 by exporting your profile. Here are the steps.

1. Open iTerm 2.
2. Select iTerm 2 > Preferences.
3. Under the General tab, check the box labeled "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:"
4. Press "Browse" and point it to `~/dotfiles/iterm2/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
5. Restart iTerm 2.
